    """Matches various input sources.

    Also "splits up" the feature metadata, first by calling
    taxonomy_utils.split_taxonomy() on it and then by splitting the resulting
    DataFrame into two separate DataFrames (one for tips and one for internal
    nodes).

    Parameters
    ----------
    bp_tree: bp.BP
        The tree to be visualized.
    table: biom.Table
        Representation of the feature table. It's expected that feature IDs in
        the table only describe tips in the tree, not internal nodes.
    sample_metadata: pd.DataFrame
        Sample metadata. The index should describe sample IDs; the columns
        should describe different sample metadata fields' names.
    feature_metadata: pd.DataFrame or None
        Feature metadata. If this is passed, the index should describe feature
        IDs and the columns should describe different feature metadata fields'
        names. (Feature IDs here can describe tips or internal nodes in the
        tree.)
    ordination: skbio.OrdinationResults, optional
        The ordination to display in an empire plot.
    ignore_missing_samples: bool
        If True, pads missing samples (i.e. samples in the table but not the
        metadata) with placeholder metadata. If False, raises a
        DataMatchingError if any such samples exist. (Note that in either case,
        samples in the metadata but not in the table are filtered out; and if
        no samples are shared between the table and metadata, a
        DataMatchingError is raised regardless.) This is analogous to the
        ignore_missing_samples flag in Emperor.
    filter_extra_samples: bool, optional
        If True, ignores samples in the feature table that are not present in
        the ordination. If False, raises a DataMatchingError if such samples
        exist.
    filter_missing_features: bool
        If True, filters features from the table that aren't present as tips in
        the tree. If False, raises a DataMatchingError if any such features
        exist. (Note that in either case, features in the tree but not in the
        table are preserved.)

    Returns
    -------
    (table, sample_metadata, tip_metadata, int_metadata):
        (biom.Table, pd.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame / None, pd.DataFrame / None)
        Versions of the input table, sample metadata, and feature metadata
        filtered such that:
            -The table only contains features also present as tips in the tree.
            -The sample metadata only contains samples also present in the
             table.
            -Samples present in the table but not in the sample metadata will
             have all of their sample metadata values set to "This sample has
             no metadata". (This will only be done if ignore_missing_samples is
             True; otherwise, this situation will trigger an error. See below.)
            -If feature metadata was not passed, tip_metadata and int_metadata
             will both be None. Otherwise, tip_metadata will contain the
             entries of the feature metadata where the feature name was present
             as a tip in the tree, and int_metadata will contain the entries
             of the feature metadata where the feature name was present as
             internal node(s) in the tree.
                -Also, for sanity's sake, this will call
                 taxonomy_utils.split_taxonomy() on the feature metadata before
                 splitting it up into tip and internal node metadata.

    Raises
    ------
    DataMatchingError
        If any of the following conditions are met:
            1. No features are shared between the tree's tips and table.
            2. There are features present in the table but not as tips in the
               tree, AND filter_missing_features is False.
            3. No samples are shared between the sample metadata and table.
            4. There are samples present in the table but not in the sample
               metadata, AND ignore_missing_samples is False.
            5. The feature metadata was passed, but no features present in it
               are also present as tips or internal nodes in the tree.
            6. The ordination AND feature table don't have exactly the same
               samples.
