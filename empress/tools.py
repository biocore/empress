    """Prints a message if a given DataFrame has been filtered.

       Essentially, this function just checks if
       df_old.shape[axis_num] - df_new.shape[axis_num] > 0.

       If so, this prints a message with a bunch of details (which the _name
       parameters all describe).

    Parameters
    ----------

    df_old: pd.DataFrame (or pd.SparseDataFrame)
         "Unfiltered" DataFrame -- used as the reference when trying to
         determine if df_new has been filtered.

    df_new: pd.DataFrame (or pd.SparseDataFrame)
         A potentially-filtered DataFrame.

    axis_num: int
         The axis in the DataFrames' .shapes to check. This should be either
         0 or 1, but we don't explicitly check for that.

    item_name: str
         The name of the "thing" described by the given axis in these
         DataFrames. In practice, this is either "sample" or "feature".

    df_name: str
         The name of the DataFrame represented by df_old and df_new.

    filter_basis_name: str
         The name of the other DataFrame which caused these items to be
         dropped. For example, if we're checking to see if samples were
         dropped from the sample metadata file due to to samples not being
         in the table, df_name could be "sample metadata file" and
         filter_basis_name could be "table".

    Parameters
    ----------

    tree: empress.tree.Tree
        The tree to be visualized.

    table: pd.DataFrame
        Representation of the feature table (containing features' abundances in
        samples).

    sample_metadata: pd.DataFrame
        Sample metadata. The index should describe sample IDs; the columns
        should describe different sample metadata fields' names.

    feature_metadata: pd.DataFrame or None
        Feature metadata. If this is passed, the index should describe feature
        IDs and the columns should describe different feature metadata fields'
        names.

    Returns
    -------

    (table, sample_metadata): (pd.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame)
        Versions of the input table and sample metadata filtered such that:
            -The table only contains samples also present in the sample
             metadata.
            -The table only contains features also present in the tree.
            -The sample metadata only contains samples also present in the

    Raises
