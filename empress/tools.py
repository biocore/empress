    filter_missing_features=False
):
    """Matches various input sources.

    Parameters
    ----------

    tree: empress.tree.Tree
        The tree to be visualized.
    table: pd.DataFrame
        Representation of the feature table. The index should describe feature
        IDs; the columns should describe sample IDs.
    sample_metadata: pd.DataFrame
        Sample metadata. The index should describe sample IDs; the columns
        should describe different sample metadata fields' names.
    feature_metadata: pd.DataFrame or None
        Feature metadata. If this is passed, the index should describe feature
        IDs and the columns should describe different feature metadata fields'
        names. NOTE: THIS CURRENTLY IS NOT CHECKED, BUT IT SHOULD BE IN THE
        FUTURE WHEN #130 IS ADDRESSED.
    ignore_missing_samples: bool
        If True, pads missing samples (i.e. samples in the table but not the
        metadata) with placeholder metadata. If False, raises a
        DataMatchingError if any such samples exist. (Note that in either case,
        samples in the metadata but not in the table are filtered out; and if
        no samples are shared between the table and metadata, a
        DataMatchingError is raised regardless.) This is analogous to the
        ignore_missing_samples flag in Emperor.
    filter_missing_features: bool
        If True, filters features from the table that aren't present as tips in
        the tree. If False, raises a DataMatchingError if any such features
        exist. (Note that in either case, features in the tree but not in the
        table are preserved.)

    Returns
    -------
    (table, sample_metadata): (pd.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame)
        Versions of the input table and sample metadata filtered such that:
            -The table only contains features also present as tips in the tree.
            -The sample metadata only contains samples also present in the
             table.
            -Samples present in the table but not in the sample metadata will
             have all of their sample metadata values set to "This sample has
             no metadata". (This will only be done if ignore_missing_samples is
             True; otherwise, this situation will trigger an error. See below.)

    Raises
    ------
    DataMatchingError
        If any of the following conditions are met:
            1. No features are shared between the tree's tips and table.
            2. There are features present in the table but not as tips in the
               tree, AND filter_missing_features is False.
            3. No samples are shared between the sample metadata and table.
            4. There are samples present in the table but not in the sample
               metadata, AND ignore_missing_samples is False.
