def remove_empty_samples_and_features(table, sample_metadata, ordination=None):
    """Removes empty samples and features from the table and sample metadata.

    This should be called *after* matching the table with the sample metadata
    and other input artifacts: we assume that the columns of the table
    DataFrame are equivalent to the indices of the sample metadata DataFrame.

    Parameters
    ----------
    table: pd.DataFrame
        Representation of a feature table. The index should describe feature
        IDs; the columns should describe sample IDs.
    sample_metadata: pd.DataFrame
        Sample metadata. The index should describe sample IDs, and the columns
        should describe sample metadata fields (e.g. "body site").
    ordination: skbio.OrdinationResults, optional
        Ordination information to show in Emperor alongside Empress. If this is
        passed, this function will check to see if any of the empty samples
        or features to be removed from the table are included in the
        ordination; if so, this will raise an error (because these empty
        items shouldn't be in the ordination in the first place).

    Returns
    -------
    filtered_table: pd.DataFrame
        Copy of the input feature table with empty samples and features
        removed.
    filtered_sample_metadata: pd.DataFrame
        Copy of the input sample metadata with empty samples removed.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        - If the input table is completely empty (i.e. all zeroes).
        - If ordination is not None, and the ordination contains empty samples
          or features.

    ----------

        samples / features have already been removed from the table.

    Returns

            Inverse of s_ids: this maps sample IDs to their indices in s_ids.
            "Indices" refers to a feature or sample's 0-based position in f_ids

    We could ostensibly save more space by identifying repeated metadata
    values and mapping *those* to integer IDs. (For example, a lot of Qiita
    studies' sample metadata files have lots of frequently repeated values like
    "host_subject_id", the various empo_* fields, etc.) However, that may be

    ----------

    metadata: pd.DataFrame

            list holds an "inner list" of length len(metadata_columns).

    Parameters
