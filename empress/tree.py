        Works analogously to the rectangular layout:

            -Each tip is assigned a unique angle from the "center"/root of
             the tree (out of the range [0, 2pi] in radians), and internal
             nodes are set to an angle equal to the average of their
             children's. This mirrors the assignment of y-coordinates for
             the rectangular layout.

            -All nodes are then assigned a radius equal to the sum of their
             branch lengths descending from the root (but not including
             the root's branch length, if provided -- the root is represented
             as just a single point in the center of the layout). This mirrors
             the assignment of x-coordinates for the rectangular layout.

            -Lastly, we'll draw arcs for every internal node (except for the
             root) connecting the "start points" of the child nodes of that
             node with the minimum and maximum angle. (These points should
             occur at the radius equal to the "end" of the given internal
             node.)
                We don't draw this arc for the root node because we don't draw
                the root the same way we do the other nodes in the tree:
                the root is represented as just a single point at the center
                of the layout. Due to this, there isn't a way to draw an arc
                from the root, since the root's "end" is at the same point as
                its beginning (so the arc wouldn't be visible).

        Following this algorithm, nodes' circular layout coordinates are
        accessible at [node].xc and [node].yc. Angles will also be available
        at [node].clangle, and radii will be available at [node].clradius; and
        for non-root internal nodes, arc start and end coordinates will be
        available at [node].arcx0, [node].arcy0, [node].arcx1, & [node].arcy1.

        This function will update the x1, y1, x2, y2, and angle attributes
        for all of the nodes within the tree. Note that (once the unrooted
        layout has finished) all that is really used are the x2 and y2
        attributes.

        In a server-based version of Empress, this could be applied when
        the tree becomes modified (i.e. pruning or collapsing) and the
        resulting coordinates would be modified to reflect the changes
        to the tree structure. (In practice, we just run this once on the
        Python side of things in order to precompute the layout.)
