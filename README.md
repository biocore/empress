# Introduction  

Empress is a fast and scalable [phylogenetic tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree) viewer that lets you interactively explore the hierarchical relationships between features in your dataset. While historically these features often represented evolutionary relationships of species in community surveys, and are characterized by their phylogeny or genetic similarity/differences, you can in fact view any type of information with hierarchical organization. For example, you can view trees of [amplicon sequence variants (ASVs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplicon_sequence_variant), or metabolite trees of LC-MS data using [q2-qemistree](https://github.com/biocore/q2-qemistree) ([ref](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.04.077636v1)).

# Installation   

Currently, Empress is only accessible as a QIIME 2 plugin. To follow this tutorial you will need to have a QIIME 2 (version 2019.10 or newer) conda environment installed and activated. See the [QIIME 2 installation](https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.6/install/) page for installation instructions.  
Once you have QIIME 2 installed, make sure the conda environment is activated by running:

```
conda activate qiime2-2020.6
```

You can replace `qiime2-2020.6` above with whichever version of QIIME 2 you have currently installed.  

Now we are ready to install Empress. Run the following commands:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/biocore/empress.git
qiime dev refresh-cache
qiime empress --help
```

If you see information about Empress' QIIME 2 plugin, the installation was successful!

# Example: Using Empress in QIIME 2   

In this tutorial we will be using Empress within the QIIME 2 environment, and demonstrating its basic usage with the [Moving Pictures tutorial](https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.6/tutorials/moving-pictures/) dataset, a set of human microbiome samples from two individuals at four body sites across five timepoints.  

## Downloading Input Artifacts and Metadata  

Before we start, we’ll need to download the necessary input artifacts. The first four of these artifacts are produced during the [Moving Pictures tutorial](https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.6/tutorials/moving-pictures/), and the last artifact was produced afterwards using data from the tutorial. These artifacts are:

1. A feature table (a QIIME 2 artifact of type `FeatureTable[Frequency]`)
2. A sample metadata file (a [tab-separated-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values) file)
3. A rooted tree (a QIIME 2 artifact of type `Phylogeny[Rooted]`)
4. Taxonomic assignments of our features (a QIIME 2 artifact of type `FeatureData[Taxonomy]`)
5. A PCoA biplot results file (a QIIME 2 artifact of type `PCoAResults % Properties('biplot')`)
    - This artifact in particular was produced by the [`qiime diversity pcoa`](https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.6/plugins/available/diversity/pcoa-biplot/) plugin, but ordinations / biplots created by other tools (e.g. [DEICODE](https://github.com/biocore/DEICODE/)) also work well with Empress.

The last item is required only when displaying an Empress tree plot in tandem with an Emperor PCoA plot/biplot (a.k.a. an Empire plot!)

First we’ll create a directory to download our files to and change into it:  

```bash
mkdir empress-tutorial
cd empress-tutorial
```

Now download the files:   
```bash

We are now ready to create our interactive tree plot.  

## Empress Plot  

We’ll start with a simple stand-alone tree visualization artifact and explore our tree using the various features in Empress.

```bash
qiime empress plot \
    --i-tree rooted-tree.qza \
    --i-feature-table table.qza \
    --m-sample-metadata-file sample_metadata.tsv \
    --m-feature-metadata-file taxonomy.qza \
    --o-visualization empress-tree.qzv
```

To view the newly made `empress-tree.qzv` artifact, you can drag and drop the file onto [https://view.qiime2.org/](https://view.qiime2.org/) or load it locally by running:   

```bash
qiime tools view empress-tree.qzv
```
![empress_plain](docs/moving-pictures/img/empress_plain.png)

The starting plot is a simple unrooted tree which has all the normal properties of a phylogenetic tree. The outermost “tips” of the tree are referred to as “leaves”, “terminal nodes”, or “external nodes” and here represent a unique ASV. The line connected to this external node is referred to as a “branch”. A branch connects two or more nodes, in this case an external node to an internal node. These internal nodes represent a divergent point between nodes and the branch length represents the evolutionary distance between divergence points.
You can use your mouse’s scroll wheel to zoom in and out, and click and drag anywhere on the plot to move the display to take a closer look at the various tree components. On the top-right we see a display menu with several subcategories that allow us to customize the plot. We will explore these options in more detail below.  


### Exploring individual features  

The first thing you likely noticed in this plot is the presence of several very long branches that stand out relative to the others. Let’s investigate these further. Zoom in on the external node of the longest branch and click on the node.   


A new menu appears with details about the selected node, including its name and taxonomic assignment. You’ll notice that this feature has -unexpectedly- only been classified at the Kingdom level, meaning that our feature-classifier was not able to find a suitable match in our reference database (Greengenes).  More often than not, these features correspond to non-biological reads such as chimeras, contaminants, or reads that have [index-hopped](https://www.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-marketing/documents/products/whitepapers/index-hopping-white-paper-770-2017-004.pdf) from other samples. We will explore these possibilities further later. Also note that the tree used in this tutorial was built using the common *de novo* tree-building approach and it has previously been shown that the presence of these outlier branches in *de novo* trees can lead to artificial clustering of samples [(Janssen et. al 2018)](https://msystems.asm.org/content/3/3/e00021-18).
In this window we can also select to view details about sample-metadata related to this feature. From the drop down menu select `body-site` and click the *Add* button. A new *Sample Presence Information* summary table appears which displays the number of samples containing the selected feature. We can see that our ASV is present in only 1 *left palm* sample. You can select multiple metadata columns. While the table here does not give us information about the abundance of this feature, we can easily search the feature name in the [feature table summary visualization](https://view.qiime2.org/visualization/?src=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.qiime2.org%2F2020.6%2Fdata%2Ftutorials%2Fmoving-pictures%2Ftable.qzv&type=html) artifact created previously in Moving Pictures tutorial. From there we see that this particular feature has a total abundance of 2, which is another strong indicator of a non-biological read. Try clicking the external nodes in a few other outlier branches. Do you see a similar pattern? Now try clicking on an external node of one of the shorter branches. Notice the much improved classification!

![empress_search_feature](docs/moving-pictures/img/empress_search_features.png)

We can also locate specific features of interest using the search bar at the top of the main menu. For example, in our feature-table the most abundant ASV is `4b5eeb300368260019c1fbc7a3c718fc`. Paste this name in to the search bar and click *Search*.  
The feature’s external node is now highlighted on the tree as a bright green circle. The most abundant ASV is a species belonging to the Bacteroides genus.  


### Exploring groups of features

Another way of exploring the classification of our features is to color the branches based on their taxonomic designation. From the main menu, click *Feature Metadata Coloring*, check the *Color by…* box and select *Level 2* which here corresponds to the Phylum level, and click *Update*.  

![empress_unrooted_feature_coloring](docs/moving-pictures/img/empress_unrooted_feature_coloring.png)

The plot is now updated so each branch is now colored by its Phylum level classification. We can see that the extra long branches are all the same color. Hover the cursor over the legend box and scroll to the bottom. The magenta color corresponds to an *Unspecified* Phylum. You may also have noticed that these outlier branches appear mainly in 2 distinct clusters. While we don’t have any more information about the classification of these features, perhaps we can gain some more insight regarding their classification by looking at their closest common ancestors that do have taxonomic information.   

### Exploring a feature’s closest common ancestors  

So far, we’ve looked at our data using the default unrooted tree view. To visually locate these features’ closest common ancestors, it may be easier to switch to a different layout. From the main menu, click *Layout* then select *Circular* (or *Rectangular*). Our plot automatically switches to a rooted layout.

Now zoom into the longest branch of the top cluster and click on the closest external node that has a different Phylum classification (light blue).   

![empress_circular_common_ancestor](docs/moving-pictures/img/empress_circular_common_ancestor.png)

Interestingly, we see that this node is classified as _Acanthamoeba Palestinensis_ which is actually not a bacteria but rather a protozoa. It is not uncommon for certain Eukaryotes to appear in bacterial/archaeal reference databases as they may share a similar genetic lineage. Remember that mitochondria and chloroplasts likely evolved from prokaryotes themselves. Explore a few other common ancestral nodes from different outlier branches. We can see other surprising appearances by _Cucurbita pepo_ (a variety of squash or pumpkin), _Raphanus sativus_ (radish), and _Streptophyta_ (an order of plants). Based on these results one might speculate that our *Unspecified* features likely also belong to either plants or protozoa groups rather than bacteria. Further, since these features appear only on the palm samples, it’s possible the source of these are in fact environmental contaminants rather than common human microbes.  

In summary, given the branch length of these features, their very low abundance, lack of close matches in the reference database, and having non-microbial closest common ancestors, it is probably safe to filter these features from our table as non-biologically relevant reads.  


### Identifying group-specific features   

The composition of microbial communities of the gut, tongue, and palms are very different from each other. Suppose we are interested in identifying which features are unique to each body-site and their evolutionary relationships. We can do this in Empress by colorizing our tree based on columns from our sample metadata file. From the main menu, click *Sample Metadata Coloring*, check the *Color by…* box, and from the drop-down menu select `body-site`. Click the *Update* button.  

![empress_sample_metadata_coloring](docs/moving-pictures/img/empress_sample_metadata_coloring.png)

In this plot the colored branches represent lineages that are unique to the corresponding body site while the greyed branches are those that are shared across at least 2 body-sites and thus cannot be displayed with a single color. While it is not surprising to see a large number of unique features in the gut samples (red) compared to the palm samples (blue and orange), it is interesting to see a large number of unique features between the left and right palm. Can you think of any biological reasons why the left and right palms may contain such different unique microbes? Even though the left and right palm do harbor unique features, the representative clades appear more integrated among themselves, suggesting that their phylogeny are still more similar to each other than the gut taxa which appear to cluster mainly among themselves.  

### Visualizing feature / sample metadata in barplots

Similarly to other tree visualization tools like [iTOL](https://itol.embl.de/), Empress can draw barplots in order to annotate tips of the tree with various types of information. Barplots are useful for doing this (moreso than node coloring, sometimes) because multiple "layers" of barplots can be shown at the same time -- this allows for us to view multiple types of data for the same tip simultaneously. Check out Figure 1 of [Song and Sanders et al. 2020](https://mbio.asm.org/node/61763.full) for just one example of a tree visualization using multiple layers of barplots for a pretty and effective figure.

#### First: a small warning about barplots

Although barplots are very useful for identifying patterns, be wary of
reading too much into them! The ordering of tips / clades on the same level of
the tree is [currently arbitrary](https://github.com/biocore/empress/issues/170),
and this can impact the way barplots look in ways that might not be immediately
obvious. To quote "Inferring Phylogenies" (Felsenstein 2004), pages 573–574:

> It is worth noting that by reordering tips, you can change the viewer's impression of the closeness of relationships. [...] A little judicious flipping may create a Great Chain of Being marching nicely along the sequence of names, even though the tree supports no such thing.

#### Diving into barplots: categorical feature metadata

Barplots in Empress are compatible with either the rectangular or circular layouts. Here we'll use the rectangular layout, but feel free to follow along with the circular layout if you prefer!

First off, change the layout to *Rectangular* (using the *Layout* section of the main menu), and then open up the *Barplots* section of the main menu and check the `Draw Barplots?` checkbox. Click the *Update* button that appears. By default, a red bar of uniform length will be drawn for every tip in the tree:

![empress barplots initial view](docs/moving-pictures/img/empress_barplots_1.png)

Although these bars are not very useful by default, we can _encode_ them with information based on the feature or sample metadata you passed in to Empress when generating a visualization. Let's try coloring each tip's bar by its `Level 2` feature metadata field (a.k.a. the phylum-level taxonomic assignments for the tips in this dataset): under the *Layer 1* header, check the *Color by...* box, and from the drop-down menu select `Level 2`. Click the *Update* button.

![empress barplots: phylum coloring](docs/moving-pictures/img/empress_barplots_2.png)

These patterns should look familiar -- this is the same information as we showed when coloring the tree by feature metadata earlier. We can confirm this by trying out feature metadata coloring by `Level 2` again, using the same `Classic QIIME Colors` color map (see the "Exploring groups of features" section above for a refresher on how to do this):

![empress barplots: phylum coloring and tree phylum coloring](docs/moving-pictures/img/empress_barplots_3.png)

Since both the node colorings and the barplot layer are now showing the same information (`Level 2`), this display is a bit redundant (although it is reassuring :). Let's try taking things down a level, and adjust our barplot layer to show the `Level 3` feature metadata field (a.k.a. the class-level taxonomic assignments). To do this, adjust the drop-down menu next to the *Color by...* box (under the _Layer 1_ header in the _Barplots_ section, not in the _Feature Metadata Coloring_ section) to go from `Level 2` to `Level 3`, and then click the *Update* button again.

![empress barplots: class coloring and tree phylum coloring](docs/moving-pictures/img/empress_barplots_4.png)

Things still seem mostly the same as before, but some of the large groups of phyla have now been split up into collections of different classes. Notice how the lavender-colored class is present at roughly five separate "clusters" throughout the tree: are all of these the same class? We can tell from the legend for this layer (under the heading `Level 3`) that there is only one class colored lavender here, `c__Clostridia`.

So, these lavender classes are all *Clostridia*. Does it make sense that representatives of this class are spread out throughout the tree so much? Unfortunately, yes, since *Clostridia* are -- to quote [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridia) -- "a highly [polyphyletic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphyly) class." (As an exercise, we recommend trying out adding on extra barplot layers for lower levels of taxonomy -- order, family, genus, etc. -- and seeing how things change.)

#### Barplots of sample presence information

Up until now, we've just been working with a single "barplot layer." We can add on more layers if we want -- this will let us visualize additional tip information alongside the layer we have that currently shows `Level 3` information. To add a new layer, click on the `+` button (with the label _Add another layer_). Now, click *Update* again to see what this new layer looks like.

![empress barplots: class coloring layer 1, empty layer 2, and tree phylum coloring](docs/moving-pictures/img/empress_barplots_5.png)

We have a new layer to work with!

One thing we might be interested in doing is seeing what types of samples contain each tip. This is possible using the _Sample Metadata Coloring_ functionality described above, but this only lets us see information about tips that are unique to a given sample metadata category -- and in practice many tips are often shared between multiple metadata categories, complicating things.

Let's revisit our analysis above of which tips are unique to which body sites in this dataset -- now, we'll instead be asking the related question of "which body site(s) are the tips in this dataset most frequently seen in?" To investigate this, we'll use our new barplot layer to show this information.

In order to do this, we'll need to change our new layer (_Layer 2_) from a feature metadata layer to a sample metadata layer. You can do this by clicking on the _Sample Metadata_ button underneath the text _Layer 2_. The controls available for this barplot layer should change; in order to show sample presence information for body sites, change the _Show sample info for..._ drop-down menu to `body-site`. Try clicking _Update_ to see what our new Layer 2 looks like.

![empress barplots: class coloring layer 1, bodysite layer 2, and tree phylum coloring](docs/moving-pictures/img/empress_barplots_6.png)

Layer 2 now shows a stacked barplot for each tip, based on the proportions of sample groups containing a given tip. As with layer 1, the colors are described in this layer's legend. When we zoom in, we can see things in detail:

![empress barplots: zoomed in on barplots: class coloring layer 1, bodysite layer 2](docs/moving-pictures/img/empress_barplots_7.png)

The top-most tip is only present in right palm samples (colored orange), the second-from-the-top tip is only present in gut samples (colored red), and so on. The length taken up by a "block" for a given tip is proportional to how many samples of that type contain the tip (relative to the total number of samples containing the tip; it's [not absolute](https://github.com/biocore/empress/issues/322)) -- so the fourth-from-the-top tip, for example, is present in mostly tongue samples but also present (albeit in fewer) left palm samples. When we click on this tip (name `9f1913b781d2cde1c8a4c57b7dc2ab83`) in the tree, we can see that this matches up with the _Sample Presence Information_ `body-site` summary for this tip: it's present in 2 tongue samples and 1 left palm sample.

#### Barplots of continuous feature metadata

Although drawing barplots of "categorical" feature metadata (like taxonomy
annotations) can be useful, often we'd like to display barplots of continuous
feature metadata. This can be useful for many types of information -- for
example, importance scores, [Songbird](https://github.com/biocore/songbird/)/[ALDEx2](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ALDEx2.html)/etc.-style feature differentials, and taxonomy annotation confidences.

Here we'll add on another layer describing the `Confidence`s of the taxonomy
annotations in this dataset. (See [this thread](https://forum.qiime2.org/t/confidence-values-taxonomic-assignment/13199) for details about interpreting these values.)

All of the confidence values in this dataset are numeric, but we don't _have_ to interpret them as numbers. Let's see what it looks like if we try to use a "categorical" (a.k.a. "discrete") color map for this field. Click on the `+` button to add a new layer, check the *Color by...* box, and select `Confidence`. Click the *Update* button.

![empress barplots: zoomed in on barplots: class coloring layer 1, bodysite layer 2, categorical-colored confidence layer 3](docs/moving-pictures/img/empress_barplots_8.png)

Try scrolling through this layer's legend. It should be clear that this color map (`Classic QIIME Colors`) does not make sense for this field -- although the confidence values are correctly sorted in ascending order, the actual color assignments are meaningless.

Let's try changing away from this discrete color map to a "sequential" one.
Select [`Viridis`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU) from the `Color Map` drop-down menu, and click *Update*.

![empress barplots: zoomed in on barplots: class coloring layer 1, bodysite layer 2, Viridis-ordinal-colored confidence layer 3](docs/moving-pictures/img/empress_barplots_9.png)

Try scrolling through the legend now. Things should be a bit clearer -- there's
a gradient from purple to yellow that seems to align with the `Confidence`
values. However, this color map is still not considering the actual numeric
values of these `Confidence`s: only the relative positions of these values are
taken into account. Notice how there are so many `Confidence` values with values
greater than 0.99, and that in spite of this the colors assigned to these
values vary pretty wildly (even though the minimum `Confidence` is around
0.68)!

We can fix this by checking the `Continuous values?` box (it shows up when a
sequential or diverging color map is selected). Try doing that, and then click
*Update* one last time for now:

![empress barplots: zoomed in on barplots: class coloring layer 1, bodysite layer 2, Viridis-continuous-colored confidence layer 3](docs/moving-pictures/img/empress_barplots_10.png)

Now, colors are assigned based on `Confidence`s as we might expect, using
linear interpolation.

This was a brief introduction to some of the barplot functionality available in Empress. There's a lot more that hasn't been documented here -- scaling bars' lengths by a continuous feature metadata field, adjusting the default colors or lengths of bars, and so on. We encourage you to try things out; feel free to contact us if you have any questions!

## Exporting Plots  

Once you are done customizing your tree, you can export the tree as an SVG or PNG file by going to the *Export* section in the main menu and clicking on `Export tree as SVG` or `Export tree as PNG`. You can also export the legend used for tree coloring, if the tree has been colored, using the `Export legend as SVG` button.

Currently, certain elements of the display (e.g. barplots, collapsed clades) are not included in the SVG export; we're working on making this functionality more comprehensive. Also, note that the SVG export does not change as you zoom / pan the tree, while the PNG export will change as you zoom / pan the tree.

## Empire plots! Side-by-side integration of tree and PCoA plots  

Now that you are familiar with basics, let’s try something a bit more advanced. One of the unique features of Empress is its ability to integrate a tree plot with an [Emperor](http://biocore.github.io/emperor) PCoA plot and visualize them side-by-side (these plots are internally referred to as Empire plots). To achieve this we provide a PCoA matrix (`PCoAResults` type artifact), which can be any beta diversity distance matrix, including biplots. Ordination biplots that are made using the [`qiime diversity pcoa-biplot`](https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.6/plugins/available/diversity/pcoa-biplot/) plugin, incorporate feature loadings represented by arrows that describe explanatory variables in the dataset. This functionality is also compatible with [`DEICODE` biplots](https://github.com/biocore/deicode). In this example we’ll use a PCoA biplot calculated using Unweighted UniFrac distances. To create this new plot, run the following:

```bash
qiime empress plot \
    --i-tree rooted-tree.qza \
    --i-pcoa biplot.qza \
    --i-feature-table table.qza \
    --m-sample-metadata-file sample_metadata.tsv \
    --m-feature-metadata-file taxonomy.qza \
    --p-filter-extra-samples \
    --p-number-of-features 10 \
    --o-visualization empire-biplot.qzv
```

- `empire-biplot.qzv` [view](https://view.qiime2.org/?src=https%3A%2F%2Fmchelper.ucsd.edu%2Fdownloads%2Fempress%2Fmaster%2Fempire-biplot.qzv) | [download](https://mchelper.ucsd.edu/downloads/empress/master/empire-biplot.qzv)

Load the new Empire plot. Here we see the Empress plot as before on the left, and on the right is an Emperor PCoA biplot. If you are unfamiliar with Emperor plots, you can learn more about them [here](http://biocore.github.io/emperor). Briefly, each individual circle represents a single sample’s microbial community and the distances between these circles corresponds to the Unweighted UniFrac distance between them in a reduced dimensional space. The top 10 explanatory features are shown as arrows alongside their id names. The number of features that is shown on the biplot is determined by the `--p-number-of-features` parameter.
For clarity, let’s remove the long feature-id labels. Right click anywhere on the Emperor plot and select *Toggle label visibility*. Next, in Emperor, from the main menu click on *Select a color category* and select `body-site` under the *scatter* subheading. Now our samples are color coded based on their body site origin. Notice the clear clustering of these sample-types. Next, click on the same drop-down menu and this time under the *biplot* subheading select `Level 2`. Now we can see the top explanatory features (arrows) colored by their Phyla designation. Switch over to Empress, change the plot layout to *Circular*, and set the *Feature metadata coloring* to `Level 2` also. Minimize the menu bar to fully appreciate the plots!   

![empire_plain](docs/moving-pictures/img/empire_plain.png)

### Interacting with tree-PCoA plots  

Looking at our Emperor plot, we see a single feature from the Actinobacteria Phylum (small red arrow) that is associated with the palm samples. Click on this arrow; two changes automatically occur: 1) on the Emperor plot, the samples that contain that feature will go dim, and 2) in Empress, the plot will zoom in on the external node corresponding to that feature, where you can explore the feature’s details further as before.  

![empire_feature_arrow_selection](docs/moving-pictures/img/empire_feature_arrow_selection.png)

This interaction between Empress and Emperor can go the other direction. Selecting a node on the Empress plot will dim the samples in Emperor in which that feature is present in.  

Another way to explore our data is to select samples on Emperor and look for the corresponding features in Empress. In Emperor, hold the shift button and draw a box around a sample. The Empress plot will now temporarily highlight the branches corresponding to that sample. If you select multiple samples from different body-sites, Empress will only highlight the branches/nodes that are unique to those sample types. The shared branches remain grey. Let’s see how we can utilize this function in our dataset.   
You may have noticed that in the Emperor plot, one of the *Right Palm* samples, is strangely clustering closer to the gut samples rather than the other palm samples. On Emperor, select some of the gut samples as well as some of the palm samples from the right hand side, taking care to not include the outlier palm sample on the left. On the Empress plot you will see several branches light up as either red, orange, or blue. These colors represent the unique features found in only that body-site, shared features are left grey.

Once the samples have been deselected (within a couple of seconds), select the outlier palm sample + one of the gut samples. What do you notice? You’ll see that there are very few unique orange branches light up, suggesting that this sample shares many more features with the gut samples than the other palm samples.

This is a good example of when your data can tell you something about your metadata that you may have missed. In reality, in this experiment, this palm sample was in fact mislabelled by accident.  

## Additional Considerations

**Note**: When your ordination was created from a subset of your original dataset (e.g. the feature table was rarefied, or certain low-frequency features or samples were otherwise filtered out), we recommend that you carefully consider *which* feature table you would like to visualize in Empress. You can use either:

- A *filtered table* that matches the ordination (e.g. with rarefaction done, and/or with low-abundance features/samples removed), or
- A *raw table* -- that is, the original table before performing rarefaction/filtering for the ordination.

There are some pros and cons for either of these choices. If you use a *filtered table*, then the Empress visualization will include less data than in the *raw dataset*: this will impact sample presence information, sample metadata coloring, and other parts of the visualization. If you select the *raw table*, you might find that some nodes in the tree won't be represented by any of the samples in the ordination (if the ordination was made using a *filtered table*, and `--p-no-filter-unobserved-features-from-phylogeny` is used). If you'd like to read more about this, there's some informal discussion in [pull request 237](https://github.com/biocore/empress/pull/237).

The command above uses the *raw dataset* and removes extra samples not represented in the ordination (using the `--p-filter-extra-samples` flag)

<!---# Animations   

One unique feature that makes Empress useful for exploring time-series data or making exciting presentations is its animation capability, which allows us to stratify and view our data at each time point rather than all at once. To set up the animation sequence, click on the Animation section from the main menu. From the *Gradient* drop-down menu, select `days-since-experiment-start`, the number of unique values in this column will be equal to the number of sequences we see in the final animation. From the *Trajectory* drop-down menu, select `body-site`, this will be the grouping factor by which the branch colors will be set to. Remember that colors on the plot represent branches unique to that group, branches that are shared between groups are not colored. Click on the `Start` button to initiate the animation and minimize the menu to view the full plot. You will begin to see a sequence of plots (automatically changing every few seconds) that represent the data at each time point found in the *days-since-experiment-start* column. At any point you can pause the animation by clicking on the `Pause` button and manually browse through the time points using the `Next Frame`, `Previous Frame`, or `Resume` buttons. Click `Stop` to terminate the animations. --->
